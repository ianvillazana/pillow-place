          I don't really like your current selection of pillows. When will you 
          add more?

        <p className="paragraph">
          We're sorry that you couldn't find anything that suits your tastes. 
          We add new pillows to our store offerings regularly, so please come 
          back and check at another time. If you have any suggestions, please

          Are your pillow covers machine washable?
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It depends on what fabric the pillow cover is made from. If it's a 
          higher quality fabric, like silk or velvet, we suggest you dry clean 
          it. If you are to machine wash, use cold water on it's own and lay 
          flat to dry - do not put it in the dryer.
