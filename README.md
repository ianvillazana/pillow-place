## Disclaimer

This is not a real website and there are no actual products being sold. If you 
decide to test this project using the live website, please note that user and 
order data is saved to the database. An account is not needed in order to make a
fake purchase. If you create an account, please use a fake email and throwaway 
password. If you order something, address and credit card input is not read or 
saved - only the items in the cart. You can leave the dummy data on the purchase
form as is.
